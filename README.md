Game Off 2023 entry - Balance Tetris

A slightly different take on the traditional Tetris game!

The game is played on a set of scales.  When there are too many blocks on one
side then the scales will tip by a row, potentially making things easier or
harder.  If the scales tip too far then it's game over.

I'm currently (Jan 2024) working on a feature backlog curated from the gamejam
feedback with the intent of turning this into a more polished and fun game.
